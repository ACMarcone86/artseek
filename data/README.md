## External Datasets

### [AQUA](https://github.com/noagarcia/ArtVQA/tree/master/AQUA)

We download the dataset from the link. Then we put it in a folder named `aqua`. We move the JSON annotations file to the subfolder `annotations`, the images to the subfolder `images`, and everything else to the the subfolder `additional`. 

### [PaintingForm](https://huggingface.co/datasets/steven16/Painting-Form)

We download the dataset from the link using the Hugging Face CLI. We put the dataset in a folder named `painting_form`. Unzip the folder with the images.

### [ExplainMe](https://github.com/noagarcia/explain-paintings)

We download the annotations from the link and put them in a folder `explain_me/annotations` and copy the images from SemArt (AQUA) to the `images` folder.
