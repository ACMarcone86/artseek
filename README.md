# ArtSeek: Deep Multimodal In-Context Reasoning with Late Retrieval

![ArtSeek banner](https://picsum.photos/1200/400)

Welcome to ArtSeek, a framework for deep artwork understanding that blends vision, language, and retrieval. This repository explores how multimodal in-context reasoning can be enhanced by late interaction retrieval, enabling robust analysis of artworks, visual stories, and creative data. The project fuses image understanding, text reasoning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to answer questions, generate captions, reason about stylistic features, and support interactive exploration of artworks across modalities.

Project scope
- Multimodal learning: combine visual signals with text and metadata for richer understanding.
- In-context reasoning: leverage surrounding context to derive deeper interpretations.
- Late interaction retrieval: fetch relevant information after initial reasoning to refine answers.
- Large language models and multimoidal LLMs: integrate Qwen, Qwen2-5, and related models to support reasoning and generation.
- Research tooling: experiments, benchmarks, and reproducible pipelines for evaluating multimodal reasoning in art contexts.

Quick start
If you want to get hands-on quickly, follow these steps. The process emphasizes safety, reproducibility, and clarity so you can iterate on ideas without friction.

Prerequisites
- A modern Linux or Windows environment with Python 3.9+ (recommend Python 3.11 for best compatibility).
- PyTorch 1.12+ with CUDA support for GPU acceleration. CPU-only mode is supported but slower.
- Basic shell tools: git, curl, tar, and unzip.
- Sufficient disk space for models, datasets, and caches (roughly tens of GBs for a standard setup; more for large models).

Clone and install
- git clone https://github.com/ACMarcone86/artseek.git
- cd artseek
- Create a clean environment:
  - conda create -n artseek python=3.11
  - conda activate artseek
- Install dependencies:
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
  - If you plan to run the demo with GPU, install the appropriate CUDA toolkit and the compatible PyTorch build.

Run a quick demo
- Prepare a small sample image and a prompt:
  - python -m artseek.demo.run --image sample.jpg --prompt "Describe the artistic style and notable features."
- Observe the chain: image encoding, multimodal reasoning, and a generated explanation.
- For a quick inference with a prebuilt artifact, follow the release notes in the Releases page to download the correct binary package for your platform.

Note about releases
- The Releases page contains ready-made artifacts for quick start. Depending on your platform, you will find a binary package or a container image that bundles the necessary dependencies. For instructions on which artifact to pick and how to install, consult the Releases section below. You can access the releases here: https://github.com/ACMarcone86/artseek/releases

Features and design goals
- Clear multimodal fusion: combine visual tokens from a trained image encoder with textual embeddings from a language backbone.
- In-context capability: supply a few example prompts and reasoning traces to steer the model toward domain-relevant interpretations.
- Late retrieval module: retrieve corroborating evidence after initial reasoning to refine outputs and reduce hallucinations.
- Modular components: interchangeable encoders, retrievers, and reasoning engines enable experimentation without rewriting core code.
- Open data surface: support for standard art datasets, annotated captions, stylistic tags, and artwork metadata.
- Reproducible experiments: a lightweight pipeline for dataset preparation, training, evaluation, and logging.
- Language and code support: ready integration with Qwen family models, including variants like Qwen2-5 and VL-capable configurations.
- Extensible for research: easy to plug in new encoders, new retrieval strategies, or new evaluation metrics.

Architecture and components
- Vision encoder
  - A robust image encoder extracts rich visual features from artworks. It supports both standalone artwork analysis and scene interpretation in contextual art narratives.
- Text encoder
  - A language model backbone processes prompts, captions, and metadata. It supports in-context learning using a small set of examples.
- Multimodal fusion module
  - A flexible fusion layer combines visual and textual representations. It can be configured for early, mid, or late fusion, depending on the task.
- In-context reasoning engine
  - This module uses the fused representation to perform reasoning steps, identify relationships among elements (style, period, technique), and generate interpretations aligned with the prompt.
- Late interaction retriever
  - After initial reasoning, the system queries a retrieval index to fetch supplemental information (art catalog data, artist notes, critical essays). The retrieved content is integrated to refine the final answer.
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) loop
  - The final response is produced by a generation model that incorporates both the in-context reasoning trace and the retrieved evidence.
- Model zoo and adapters
  - The repository provides adapters to work with different LLMs (including Qwen-based models) and a small model zoo with lightweight encoders for quick experiments.

Data and artifacts
- Art datasets
  - The framework supports common art and image-text datasets, such as annotated paintings, sculpture catalogs, and installation metadata. It can also ingest custom collections via a standardized schema.
- Metadata and tags
  - Artwork metadata includes artist, period, medium, dimensions, provenance notes, and exhibition history. Tagging supports stylistic classifications like impressionism, cubism, surrealism, and contemporary digital art.
- Prompts and reasoning traces
  - The system records prompts, reasoning steps, and final outputs to support reproducibility and analysis of model behavior.
- Retrieval index
  - The late retrieval component uses a structured index that can be built from catalog records, museum notes, essay collections, and curated commentary.
- ArtSeek artifacts
  - The release artifacts bundle code, models, and sample data for quick setup. They provide a snapshot that you can run on your machine or in a container.

Model zoo and integration
- Qwen family integration
  - The project includes adapters and wrappers to run Qwen-based models, enabling efficient multimodal reasoning and text generation.
- Qwen2-5 and VL configurations
  - Variants like Qwen2-5-VL are supported for tasks that benefit from explicit vision-language alignment. These models can handle paired image-text inputs and produce coherent, context-aware outputs.
- Lightweight encoders
  - Small image encoders serve as a fast option for experiments or constrained environments. They balance speed and accuracy for rapid iteration.
- Interchangeable backends
  - The architecture is designed so you can swap the language model, the image encoder, or the retriever without rewriting the pipeline.

In-context reasoning and late retrieval
- In-context prompts
  - The system uses a few carefully crafted prompts with example reasoning traces to guide the model toward domain-aware interpretations.
- Reasoning traces
  - Each answer can include an explicit reasoning trace, making it easier to audit the model’s steps and identify where retrieval improves the result.
- Retrieval strategy
  - The late retrieval component fetches relevant essays, catalog notes, and artist statements. The retrieval content is time-bound and curated to maintain accuracy and reduce bias.
- Integration pattern
  - Retrieved text is appended to the prompt or used to condition the model’s hidden state, depending on the configured architecture. Final generation benefits from this curated evidence.

Training, fine-tuning, and evaluation
- Data preparation
  - Datasets should include images, descriptive captions, metadata, and optional reasoning hints. Preprocessing scripts normalize text, tokenize prompts, and prepare image features.
- Fine-tuning strategy
  - Fine-tuning can be done for the image encoder, the language model, or the fusion module. The best results often come from staged training: freeze encoders while tuning the fusion layer, then fine-tune end-to-end with smaller learning rates.
- Evaluation metrics
  - Multimodal accuracy, caption quality (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE), reasoning fidelity, retrieval-consistency scores, and human evaluation for aesthetic and contextual correctness.
- Baselines and ablations
  - Compare with non-retrieval baselines, single-modality baselines (vision-only, text-only), and different fusion strategies to quantify gains from in-context reasoning and late retrieval.
- Reproducibility
  - Seed control, deterministic evaluation settings when possible, and clear documentation of hyperparameters help reproduce results.

Running demos and experiments
- Demo scripts
  - demos provide end-to-end demonstration of artwork understanding, including visual question answering, captioning, and stylistic analysis.
- Inference workflow
  - Build the multimodal prompt, run the reasoning engine, trigger late retrieval, and generate the final output. The system logs the steps for transparency.
- Batch experiments
  - A lightweight experiment runner supports batch prompts, varying prompts, and comparing model variants. You can generate compact reports that summarize results across prompts.
- Visualization tools
  - Interactive dashboards show the flow from image to reasoning to retrieved content. Visualizations help analyze where retrieval improves results.

Quick architecture walkthrough
- Step 1: Image is encoded by the vision encoder to extract meaningful features.
- Step 2: Text prompts and metadata are embedded by the language backbone.
- Step 3: Fusion combines visual and textual information into a unified representation.
- Step 4: In-context reasoning produces intermediate conclusions and explanations.
- Step 5: Late retrieval fetches corroborating content from an index.
- Step 6: Final generation synthesizes image, reasoning, and retrieved material into a coherent answer.
